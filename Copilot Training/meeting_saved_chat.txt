	This file contains a script of Transact SQL (T-SQL) command to interact with a database named 'Inventory'.
	Requirements:
	- SQL Server 2022 is installed and running
	- database 'Inventory' already exists.
12:17:41 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	- Check if the database 'Inventory' exists, if not, exit with an error message.
	- Sets the default database to 'Inventory'.
	- Create a 'categories' table and related 'products' table if they do not already exist.
	- Remove all rows from the tables.
	- Populate the 'categories' table with sample data.
	- Populate the 'products' table with sample data.
	- Create stored procedures to get all categories.
	- Create a stored procedure to get all products in a specific category.
	- Create a stored procudure to get all products in a specific price range sorted by price in ascending order.
12:51:30 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	given the selected table, create a class in C++ that models the entity. Use 'm_' prefix to represent the backing fields. The result should be separated into header file and implementation.
12:52:05 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	i need  sample hourly employee data. The sample should have a header row and at least 10 rows of data. The data should include the following columns: Employee ID, Department ID, First Name, Last Name, Hourly Rate. The data should be in a CSV file format.
12:52:42 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	i need a  JSON array of 10 rows of data. The data should include the following keys: EmployeeID, DepartmentID, FirstName, LastName, HourlyRate.
12:53:57 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	How would i consume this JSON data using Python?
12:57:57 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	This app uses Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib to generate a set of data points and plot them on a graph.
13:01:32 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Create a function 'gendatapoints' that generates a set of 100 data points (x, f(x)) and returns them as a pandas data frame.
13:03:43 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Arguments:
	- 'x_range' is a tuple of two integers representing the rang0 e of x values to generate.
	Returns:
	- A pandas data frame with two columns, 'x' and 'y'.
	Details:
	- 'x' values are generated randomly between x_range[0] and x_range[1].
	- 'y' values are generated as a non-linear function of x with excessive random noise: y = x ^ 1.5  + noise.
	- The data frame is sorted by the 'x' values.
	- The data frame has 100 rows.
	Error Handling:
	- Raise a ValueError if x_range is not a tuple of two integers.
	- Raise a ValueError if x_range[0] is greater than x_range[1].
	Examples:
	- gendata((0, 100)) generates a data frame with 'x' values between 0 and 100.
	- gendata((-100, 100)) generates a data frame with 'x' values between -100 and 100.
13:06:38 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Create a function 'plot_data' that plots the data points from the data frame.
13:07:04 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Arguments:
	- 'data' is a pandas data frame with two columns, 'x' and 'y'.
	Returns:
	- None
	Details:
	- The data points are plotted as a scatter plot.
	- The plot has a title 'Data Points', x-axis label 'x', and y-axis label 'f(x)'.
13:09:51 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Create a 'main' block that uses the above functions to generate a set of data points and plot them.
	Arguments:
	- None
	Returns:
	- None

	show the selected code represented using prompt engineering so that the function can be regenerated.
13:15:48 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	show the selected code represented using prompt engineering so that the function can be regenerated.
13:15:57 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Create a function named 'execute' that executes a given packaged task in a separate thread.
	Arguments:
	- func: a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns void
	- load: an integer representing the workload. 
	Returns: void
	Details:
	- Create a packaged_task with the given function
	- Get the future from the task
	- Start the task in a separate thread using move semantics
	- Wait for the task to complete
	- Join the worker thread
	- Print "Task completed." after the task is done
	Example:
	execute(job, 10);
13:28:58 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	@workspace /tests Create a test using 'CppUnit' for the selected function
13:31:37 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	@workspace /tests create a Python unit test for a function 'filter_ints' that takes an array of ints 'numbers' and an anonymous function 'strategy' in the form: int => bool
13:34:33 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	@workspace /tests create a Doctest unit test for a C++ class 'Employees'. The class has a method 'HighEarners' that takes a function expression 'filter' in the form: double => bool.

13:38:13 From Andrew Scoppa to Everyone:
	Create a XUnit test  for a C# class 'WordMix'  that contains a public, static method 'palindrome' that takes a string as an argument and returns true if the string can be read the same from right to left or left to right.
	Details:
	- The method should be case-insensitive
	- The method should not consider spaces or punctuation
	A palindrome . Examples:
	- bob => true
	- kayak => true 
	- boat => false
	- horse => false
	- car => false
